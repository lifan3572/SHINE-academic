Dr Fan Li (ORCID: 0000-0002-3929-6625) is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering (AAE), at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKSAR. Before joining AAE, she has been a Research Fellow in Design and Human Factors Laboratory, the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Fraunhofer IDM@NTU center, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. She is interested in human-centred design, safety management, and AI-based human states modelling.

Nowadays, human factors have been increasingly recognised as the primary causal factors of aviation accidents. To improve the flexibility of human factors management, a series of context-aware human factors management strategies should be developed by collecting and analysing the dynamic interactions between humans and machines.
